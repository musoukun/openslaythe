# Slay The Robot

Slay the Robot is a comprehensive framework for Godot 4 which enables and streamlines the creation of roguelike deckbuilders similar to Slay the Spire.

## 📚 Getting Started

A [primer wiki](https://github.com/DesirePathGames/Slay-The-Robot/wiki) (WIP) has been provided in the project. There's also a quick and dirty "[translation spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J3o8d5gMbzAwjXUZgvvEui8mhHdSobRWEZeRn1sFmvs/edit?usp=sharing)" to see how the framework compares to Slay the Spire, with technical notes included.

# Features

*Some of the core features include but are not limited to:*

## 🃏 Cards, Cards, and More Cards

Cards have a massive and robust data-driven API, allowing you or users to create cards from simple JSON payloads. Almost every card in Slay the Spire is possible with this framework, many even possible without having to touch a single line of code, just by using the existing actions and card properties provided in the default framework. **Note**: JSON files are not included with the project by default and game data is generated from code. Uncomment the export line in Global._ready() and run it, then it will export the game data to JSON to be loaded on subsequent runs.

A card decorator system is included which works similar to StS 2's enchantment system. This lets you modify cards with all sorts of ad hoc effects.

## 🗂️ Content Packs

Got too many cards? Nonsense! Use card packs to query and organize even thousands of cards in a performant manner. Add a new red card to the game? The red card pack will instantly add it to the red deck and they'll start showing up. Want to suddenly start being able to draft green cards during a run? Simply add a green card pack to the player and it'll automatically sort out the rest. This keeps your data clean and extensible and saves the tedium of having to manually maintain large lists of things. The same goes for relics ("artifacts" in StR) and consumables which are also organized by packs.

## ⚔️ Action System

A system of reusable action scripts drives everything. From attacking and drawing cards, to buying things from a shop, to more technical things like generating the world, ending your turn, or incrementing/decaying a status effect all pipe through this system in an orderly and consistent fashion. There's even actions that make or modify other actions, allowing for deep nested behavior such as rudimentary for-loops, random choice, and if/else logic.

A value hierarchy ensures you have total control over where data is pulled. Restrict action parameters to a single action, or provide them to your cards so all actions inherit from them. Or even assign custom values to the player themself and pull data from there.

Actions can be assigned timers to ensure they take exactly as long as you need them to. Both synchronous and asynchronous actions are also supported. Maybe you want a card that torrents the entirety of Bee Movie, plays it, and makes the player sit through to the end before they can play another card. Hey, I'm not here to judge your impeccable taste.

## 📜 Interceptors

Data driven behavior not enough? Want to attach scripts to other scripts, setting off crazy chains that mess with the game's own internal systems through status effects and relics? Actions can be dynamically modified by action interceptors right before they run, creating complex and consistent interactions with minimal code.

Prevent the player from drawing cards, make shops more expensive, preserve your block between turns, make it so attacks hit harder, expand the amount of cards you can have in your hand? All easily possible with interceptors by writing short scripts and specifying what actions they affect and how.

The same technology that modifies actions is integrated into the UI via interception previews. This means enemy intent, card descriptions, and card play validation all use the exact same logical pipelines as the actions they represent. So if a card or enemy says it will do 5 damage, then it will do 5 damage. This makes life much easier for you and the player by avoiding two separate calculation systems.

## 🤔 Validators 

Validators drive conditional logic across the UI and game logic. Want to restrict a card to being only played under certain conditions? How about glow if there's 3 enemies? Perhaps have some additional effect when played if you have 7+ cards in hand? Maybe it only plays when the [International Space Station's urine tank is full](https://github.com/Stovoy/pISSStreamGodot)? Easy.

## 💬 Events and Dialogue

Both combat and non combat events are supported. A simple but powerful state machine driven dialogue system ensures you can write whatever events you need. Event pools control exactly what kind of events can show up and when.

## 📖 Codex

A sample codex shows all content to the player. Cards, consumables, artifacts, and enemies are displayed.

## 🎵🎞️ Audio, VFX, and Animation Support

An audio system has been included via [addon](https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_sound_manager) and hooked into the action, event, and fileloading systems. Master, music, and sfx volume sliders included and synced with user configs.

Animations can be generated easily and hooked into enemy attack patterns and cards.

## 🏃 Acts, Ascensions, and Custom Runs

A 3-Act structure is provided by default, with a custom run modifier for endless mode. Branching acts are also supported. Run modifiers and "ascensions" are handled by the same tech, making it easy to add more.

A system for run start options is also provided. Want to choose between losing all your money to gain a rare card, or maybe gain a random common relic? Decisions decisions...

## 🎲 Deterministic RNG

Random number generation is extremely important to card games and great care has been taken to ensure deterministic behavior. Automatically generate "tracks" of RNG and inject them into your actions with ease. Things like shuffling your deck, events, random card damage, and much more have all been sorted into non competing buckets so the same behavior happens every time. This ensures that no matter how hard you save scum, you'll still lose.

## 🧮 Stat Hooks and Run History

StatsHandler keeps track of everything, storing it on a current turn, total in combat, and per run basis that can be easily queried to provide cards or artifacts with conditional effects. You or users can even provide custom stats and hooks through CustomSignalData.

Run history and aggregate wins/losses are also stored in the player's profile, with flags for fine tuning what gets stored.

## 💾 Saving and Loading

The framework handles all the scary data handling work for you, automatically. Simply extend from SerializableData and add @export to a variable, and you can save and load even complex nested objects with ease in human readable JSON.

The game manages autosaves for player data all on its own, and keeps track of wins and losses in total and for each character.

## ⚙️ Mod Support

The same technology that streamlines saving and loading also makes mod support a breeze. Data, assets, and scripts (including your own!) can be loaded from external files.

Simply create a mod_info.json file, specify which folders to load from and what data types it represents, and it will automatically load them if enabled in mod_list.json. Scripts may also be trivially loaded in, allowing users to inject new behavior into the game or override existing scripts.

An example mod has been provided to see this technology in action.
